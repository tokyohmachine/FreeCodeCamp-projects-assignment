            "Ada Lovelace's trajectory as a mathematician, writer, and computer programmer was
            as remarkable as it was ahead of her time. From her pioneering work on the Analytical
            Engine to her visionary ideas about the potential of computers, she blazed a trail for
            women in STEM that continues to inspire and challenge us today."
