## Project Description
The CSS code in this repository creates an animated Ferris wheel using CSS animations and transforms. The Ferris wheel consists of a circular wheel with six cabins attached to it. The cabins are animated to rotate around the wheel, while changing their background color periodically.

The Ferris wheel is created using the `.wheel` class, which defines the circular shape, border, dimensions, and position of the wheel. The cabins are defined using the 
`.cabin` class, which specifies their size, position, and background color. The cabins are also animated using the cabins keyframe animation.

The `.line` class is used to create the six spokes of the Ferris wheel, which are positioned using CSS transforms.
